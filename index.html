<h1>ENHYPEN Interlude : Question Lyrics</h1>

<p>Arriving at a low hill after a long run
<p>  I cool off in the wind</p>
<p>I thought I'd understand If I ran
<p> But, in the end, I didn't learn a thing</p>
<p>So, what is it I want?</p>
<p>Is this correct?</p>
<p>What should I do? What choice do I make?</p>
<p>Who am I?</p>
<p> And what do I mean when I say “me”? </p>
<p>Papers with unanswered questions
<p> Endlessly written </p>
<p>Like the waves that ride the rhythm atop the sunset sea </p>
<p>For now I'll float away</p>
<p>Then I'll arrive somewhere else, another place
<p> But where will that be? </p>
